I am Alberto Varela, a 39 years old full stack developer based in Bilbao with more than 15 years of experience. I am passionate about everything related to web development and I'm currently working as Product Engineer at [Genially](https://www.genial.ly/). The easiest way
to get in touch is via email: [alberto@berriart.com](mailto:alberto@berriart.com).

</svg>{{< /rawhtml >}} Web development

I have mainly been working with Javascript (Node.js), Typescript, C# and PHP as back-end languages. I'm also front-end developer, I've worked with React, Angular, Vue, Typescript and
a lot of Vanilla JS. I have used SQLServer, MySQL and MongoDB as data storage. I'm open for alternatives when it is necessary.

I have implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines in multiple projects, including source control, software and
infrastructure automatic provisioning, unit testing, deployment, functional testing, monitoring and notifications.

</svg>{{< /rawhtml >}} Analysis &amp; Planning

I have worked in Agile teams and I have experience heading the dev department in a small start-up also. I love to learn about processes to maximize the business value delivery and I like to think that I have helped improving the workflow of the companies I've worked for.

</svg>{{< /rawhtml >}} DevOps

I believe that collaboration between development and operations is possible and I like contributing making it real. I have experience managing Linux
servers and with cloud technologies (AWS and Azure). Infrastructure as code has been a must in the last projects I worked for and I like
to spread the idea.

</svg>{{< /rawhtml >}} Meetups &amp; Conferences

I like to attend meetups and conferences, especially local ones. I have been also giving some workshops and talks at events like [Software Crafters Barcelona](https://softwarecrafters.barcelona/) or [Commit Conf](https://commit-conf.com), and I usally try to partipate on open spaces.

I am a self-taught, but I love working with people who know and can teach me. I think my two best qualities are that I like to teach what I know and
that I know I have still a lot to learn.
