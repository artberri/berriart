I am 38 years old and I am Full Stack Developer based in <a data-toggle="bilbaoModal" href="#bilbaoModal">Bilbao</a> with more than 10 years of experience. I am passionate about everything related to web development and I'm currently working as Software Developer at <a href="https://www.genial.ly/">Genially</a>. The easiest way
to get in touch is via email: [alberto@berriart.com](mailto:alberto@berriart.com).

## {{< rawhtml >}}<i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i>{{< /rawhtml >}} Web development

I have mainly been working with PHP, Javascript (Node.js), Typescript and C# as back-end languages. I'm also front-end developer, I've worked with Angular, Vue, React, Typescript and
a lot of Vanilla JS. I have used SQLServer, MySQL and MongoDB as data storage. I'm open for alternatives when it is necessary.

## {{< rawhtml >}}<i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true"></i>{{< /rawhtml >}} Continuous Integration

I have implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines in multiple projects, including source control, software and
infrastructure automatic provisioning, unit testing, deployment, functional testing, monitoring and notifications.

## {{< rawhtml >}}<i class="fa fa-comments-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>{{< /rawhtml >}} Analysis &amp; Planning

I have worked in Agile teams and I have experience heading the dev department in an small start-up also. I love to learn about processes to maximize the business value delivery and I like to think that I have helped improving the workflow of the companies I worked for.

## {{< rawhtml >}}<i class="fa fa-server" aria-hidden="true"></i>{{< /rawhtml >}} DevOps

I believe that collaboration between development and operations is possible and I like contributing making it real. I have experience managing Linux
servers and with cloud technologies (AWS and Azure). Infrastructure as code has been a must in the last projects I worked for and I like
to spread the idea.

## {{< rawhtml >}}<i class="fa fa-microphone" aria-hidden="true"></i>{{< /rawhtml >}} Meetups &amp; Conferences

I like to attend meetups and conferences, especially local ones. I have been also giving some workshops and talks at events like [Software Crafters Barcelona](https://softwarecrafters.barcelona/) or [Commit Conf](https://commit-conf.com), and I usally try to partipate on open spaces.

## {{< rawhtml >}}<i class="fa fa-hand-spock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>{{< /rawhtml >}} Others

I am a self-taught, but I love working with people who know and can teach me. I think my two best qualities are that I like to teach what I know and
that I know I have still a lot to learn.
